  "description":"For the past couple of years, I have handled projects from an Engineering design position, where I built 3D models per OEM requirements. I created drawings for customers and documentation. Prior, I have over 10 years of experience working in the validation group and performing FEA analysis of concept designs, and creating FEA methods for the group. For these reasons, I feel I would be a good fit at Trimble as a Mechanical Engineer.",
