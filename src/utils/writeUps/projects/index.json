            "responsibility" : "Created a website that would help a client launch their new business. I needed to create a website that allowed the client to add content about their current projects and to be able to receive inquiries about their services. The project is a perfect candidate for JAM Stack.",
            "details" : "The project uses Astro.build. Which is a modern server-side template language. Being a landing page for a business I didn't want to ship a bunch of JS to the client. Astro ships only HTML & CSS, and less JavaScript, which allows fast pages. The Client wanted to add content about the projects that they have accomplished so I research headless CMS and decided to use Strapi.io to handle the content. For a simple email system, I choose to use FORMSUBMIT. That will send an e-mail to the client's inbox about any inquiries. The project allowed me to better understand SEO, and what needs to be on a site to get noticed. It also encouraged me to communicate and understand what the client needs to accomplish their goal.",

Upon selecting the file, Visual-basic would loop through the text searching for key displacement values that would be extracted into an excel file and converted to stiffness values. At this point, the engineer would be able to review and confirm that the results make sense. Once the engineer approved the results then they would be able to commit them to the database, for simplicity would just be a worksheet that contained all model results for the whole project. Then from results a report could be generated.",

This app challenged me due to my lack of experience in mobile development. To get the app up and running quickly I used a React Native boilerplate that is maintained by Infinite Red team. The first challenge I would need to understand is how to perform Optical Character Recognition and the ecosystem. I added Google's ML Kit Text Recognition API. The API would allow that app to find the letters in a photo. Then learning how to handle the UI, I leaned on a component library called Native Base, which helped create clean user interfaces. This project challenged me and excited me in learning more about mobile development with React Native.",

I attended Python training at DS Simulia the training taught me the basics of Python and gave me a high-level understanding of the Abaqus scripting capabilities. I used Python that would extract the results from a SQL database. Then used Python to compile results and saved  EXCEL documents from stiffness results.  I have explored a bit of data visualization and data manipulation. Allowed me to understand basic programming and the importance of unit testing.",
