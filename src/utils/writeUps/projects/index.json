I needed to create a website that allowed the client to add content about their current projects and to be able to receive inquiries about their services. The project is a perfect candidate for JAM Stack.",
            "details" : "The project uses Astro.build. Which is a modern server-side template language. Being a landing page for a business I didn't want to ship a bunch of JS to the client. Astro ships only HTML & CSS, and less JavaScript, which allows fast pages. The Client wanted to add content about the projects that they have accomplished so I research headless CMS and decided to use Strapi.io to handle the content. For a simple email system, I choose to use FORMSUBMIT. That will send an e-mail to the client's inbox about any inquiries. The project allowed me to better understand SEO, and what needs to be on a site to get noticed. It also encouraged me to communicate and understand what the client needs to accomplish their goal.",

Upon selecting the file Visual basic would loop through the text searching for key displacement values that would be extracted into an excel file and converted to stiffness values. At this point, the engineer would be able to review and confirm that the results make sense. Once the engineer approved the results then they would be able to commit them to the database, for simplicity would just be a worksheet that contained all model results for the whole project and a report could be generated.",

Allowing me to experience new technologies and other methods and techniques in developing an App. I went with React Native since I had a good understanding of REACT.js. This app challenged me due to my lack of experience in mobile development. I had to spend some time researching and understanding the React Native ecosystem to build the application. First I needed to understand how to perform Optical Character Recognition. I landed on Google's ML Kit Text Recognition API which allowed me to perform the OCR functions on the device. Then learning how to handle the UI, I leaned on a component library called Native Base, which helped create clean user interfaces. This project challenged me and excited me in learning more about mobile development with React Native.",

I attended Python training at DS Simulia which taught me the basics of Python and me have a high-level understanding of the Abaqus scripting capabilities. I have used Python to create EXCEL documents from stiffness results. These results were pulled from an SQL database that I created. I have explored a bit of data visualization and data manipulation.
