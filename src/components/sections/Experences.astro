				<p>
				To round out my Engineering career, I choose to join the Design Team. I would be able to use my experience from validation to build better products.
				 Moving into Design will allow me to have a more involved in directing the project and helping produce products that would meet customers' requirements.

				<h3 class="my-10 text-2xl font-extrabold text-center">Automotive Engineering for the Validation Group</h3>
				<p>
				In 2005 I joined the CAE / Validation group, The group was a new group and consisted of 4 people including me. 
				I needed to learn on my own, to be adaptable to any new jobs presented to the group.
				 Being a newly established group I established best practices and methods that are still in use today. 
				 In my 10 plus years of experience, I have participated in difficult competitions that challenge the spirit to achieve 
				 difficult performance targets.</p>
